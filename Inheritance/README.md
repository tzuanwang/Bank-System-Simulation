## Inheritance
* Child class inherits certain characteristics and features from parent class
* Child class can have its own attributes and methods and have access to attributes and methods of the parent class
* **Single inheritance**
* **Multiple inheritance**: the value of the same attribute names from multiple base classes depends on the order of inheritance
* **Multi-level inheritance**: the lower level classes will have access to all the attributes and methods to all the classes in the upper levels.
* **Public**: memberName, accessible to your class, derived classes, and anywhere outside your derived classes
* **Protected**: _memberName, accessible to your class, derived classes
* **Private**: __memberName, only accessible to your class
