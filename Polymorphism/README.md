## Polymorphism
* The ability of an entity to present in more than one form
* super().methodName: access to the methods of the base class
* **Diamond Shape Problem**
* Special Method: __methodName__
* Abstract Base Class (ABC): does not have definition on its own and has abstract methods which forces the implementation in its derived classes
* It's not allowed to instantiate objects for a abstract base class
