 Python OOP : Four Pillars of OOP in Python 3 for Beginners

## Classes and Objects
* Noun => Class
* Adjective => Attribute => properties that define your class further
* Verb => Method => functions that perform a specific task
* Everything in Python is an object

## Attributes and Methods
* A **class attribute** is common to all the instances of your class
* An **instance attribute** is specific to each instance of your class
* Check the class attribute first, and then check the instance attribute
* The lifespan of attributes with **self** parameter: creation to deletion an object
* Otherwise, the lifespan is only within the method
* Instance Methods are methods of your class that make use of self parameter to access and modify the instance attribute of your class
* Static Methods are methods that do not take the default self parameter and ignore the binding of the object
* decorators (@): functions that take another function and extend their functionality
* init method: the first method being called at the time of object creation
